Sublime Files
=============

__A keyboard driven file management/navigation plugin for Sublime Text 2.__

------------

Sublime Files works entirely through the command pallette. By running the
Sublime Files Navigator, you can "cd" around directories similar to how
you would on a command line. On selecting a file, a user is presented with 
the following options:


* Open
* Rename
* Delete
* Copy
* Move


Because Sublime Files actually navigates the file system by changing directories,
the navigator remembers and starts from last visited directory on subsequent uses.
To open the navigator, you can either just invoke the command pallette command or
use the keybinding ctrl+super+n 


Built with Mac OSX and entirely untested / most likely unreiable for Windows users.

__TODO__


* Implement commands for moving/renaming directories, not just files
* Implement easily moving to the directory of the file currently editing
