Sublime Files
=============
Sublime Files is a keyboard driven file management/navigation plugin.
Sublime Files works entirely through the command pallette. By running the
Sublime Files Navigator, you can "cd" around directories similar to how
you would on a command line. On selecting a file, a user is presented with 
the following options:


* Open
* Rename
* Delete
* Copy
* Move


Because Sublime Files actually navigates the file system by changing directories,
the navigator remembers and starts from last visited directory on subsequent uses.
