Sublime Files
=============
Sublime Files is a keyboard driven file management/navigation plugin.
Sublime Files works entirely through the command pallette. By running the
Sublime Files Navigator, you can "cd" around directories similar to how
you would on a command line. On selecting a file, a user is presented with 
the following options:
    * Open
    * Rename
    # Delete
    * Copy
    * Move
