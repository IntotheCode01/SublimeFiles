Currently nothing more then proof of concept. Obviously needs work.

TODO:
-current scheme for changing directories is basically insane. Switch to using os.chdir()
-add to command pallette / create keybindings
-currently always start at "~/". Would be preferrable to have some way
 for user to specify the "home" directory
