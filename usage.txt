Sublime Files Plugin Usage

----

Sublime files an be activated with the command palette command: "Sublime Files: Open Navigator", or with
the key command ctrl+super+n (or ctrl+alt+n for windows).

Directories and files will show up. By selecting a directory, Sublime Files will move into the directory.
By selecting a file, Sublime Files will pop up options that can be applied onto the file.

Options of note are ".", "..", "~/", and "\* To current view". 

"." Stays in the current directory, and provides potential options for manipulating the current directory. 
(current only allows creating new files into the directory).

".." navigates one level above the current directory, "~/" goes to the home directory, and "\* To current view" goes to the directory containing the current file being edited.
